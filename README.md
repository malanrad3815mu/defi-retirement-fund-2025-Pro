## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a hypothetical **DeFi Retirement Fund** would integrate with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

It's crucial to understand that this integration is not direct in the way DeFi protocols talk to each other on a blockchain. Instead, it's a multi-layered architecture that bridges the decentralized world of the fund with the centralized order books of the exchanges.

### Core Concept: The Bridge Between DeFi and CeFi

A DeFi retirement fund's goal is to offer a self-custodial, transparent, and automated retirement savings vehicle. To achieve optimal pricing and liquidity, it *must* access the deep liquidity pools of major CEXs. The integration happens primarily through a specialized piece of infrastructure.
